# Compare Pokemon Stats

## Description

This project is a simple app to compare pokemon stats, made to practice using asynchronous functions and making API requests. When users enter the names of two pokemon, the app requests their data to the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and displays a chart with their stats using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).
